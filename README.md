# JacoRobot
Kinematics of the Jaco Robot:
- FK_4DOF:      Forward kinematics of the 4-DOFs Jaco robot. Based on modified DH-parameters. 
- FK_6DOF_curv: Forward kinematics of the 6-DOFs Jaco robot, non-decoupled. Based on modified DH-parameters. 
- FK_6DOF_sphr: Forward kinematics of the 6-DOFs Jaco robot, decoupled. Based on modified DH-parameters. 
- IK_4DOF:      Inverse kinematics of the 4-DOFs Jaco robot. Geometrical determination. 
- IK_6DOF_sphr: Inverse kinematics of the 6-DOFs Jaco robot, non-decoupled. Geometrical determination. Only the position problem has been solved. 
- fcn_Tmatrix:  Build the transformation matrix SE(3). Based on the modified DH-parameters.
